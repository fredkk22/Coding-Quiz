## Description

This Module 4 Challenge was to attempt to create a coding quiz for programmers to test them on their knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and to store the scores recorded from the index.html file in a High Scores page, which I titled highscores.html, separate from the index.html document.

The reason for creating a random password generator was to further delve into Javascript methods, for loops, functions, if statements, event listeners, create and append child element, and how to link information from one page of our website to another. Its function was also to teach us how to create and link our own Javascript files to our index.html files from scratch.

I was able to learn everything I listed above and have become much more comfortable using what we have learned thus far to be "vanilla" Javascript, or Javascript without the inclusion of jQuery. Therefore, I accomplished everything I was aiming to learn through this challenge.
